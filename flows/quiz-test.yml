            # Least squares problems

            Let $m\ge n$ and $\boldsymbol A$ be an $m\times n$ matrix. Which of the
            following conditions suffices to guarantee that
            the least squares system $\boldsymbol A \boldsymbol x\cong \boldsymbol b$
            has a *unique* solution?

        choices:

          - Always
          - When $\operatorname{rank}(\boldsymbol A)=m$
          - ~CORRECT~ When $\operatorname{rank}(\boldsymbol A)=n$
          - When $\boldsymbol b$ lies in $\operatorname{span}(\boldsymbol A)$
          - This is a really long option, but *certainly* not the correct one.

            Instead, it tests whether Markdown works in choice questions.
